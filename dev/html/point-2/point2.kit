How the car performs is dependent on the drag that is created when there are other surrounding cars as well as on the air flow around the car. “Aerodynamic drag increased with the square of speed”, so drivers need to be on high alert as to how they drive alongside others as this is a factor that affects the speed and fuel efficiency.</p>

On one hand, drivers need to drive as efficiently as possible in order to reduce the amount of tire wear. On the other hand, pit crews need to service the car as quickly as possible so the driver can get back in the race. The way in which the driver pulls up to the pit crew is determined by the “lollipop man”, who will hold out a lollipop shaped object to indicate the best area for a driver to stop. As soon as the driver presses the breaks, the clock is counting down, and members are rushing against time to adjust the car and to check for any faults in it while they change out the tires.
 If the pit crew is slow then the driver could go from 1st to 2nd.

                                    <p>In addition to the pit crew, there are also the engineers who work endlessly to build the car. Modifying a car based off of the rules takes a skilled team member who understands the personality of the driver and their behaviors as they drive. The same factors that the driver and the pit crew have to consider-- the engineer has to as well.

                        In any sport, strategies are an integral part to a game, a heat, or a session. They are used by both individuals, (i.e swimming, boxing, snowboarding), and teams, (i.e basketball, soccer, football) to advance their objective:
                        to win. NASCAR is a sport, because drivers and their pit crew work together to win the race.
