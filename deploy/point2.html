                        In any sport, strategies are an integral part to a game, a heat, or a session. They are used by both individuals, (i.e swimming, boxing, snowboarding), and teams, (i.e basketball, soccer, football) to advance their objective:
                        to win. NASCAR is a sport, because drivers and their pit crew work together to win the race.
