                <p>In football, the NFL allows a maximum of 53 players on its roster and only 46 of these may be eligible to play on game days. This is to account for player injuries that could occur during a play, as well as their staminas, and unique characteristics. NFL football players will work with their coach to maximize their output in order to achieve the most touchdowns and have the best defense line.</p>

                <p>Similarly, NASCAR upholds numerous rules and regulations that transcend all racing series. For the 2020 season, officials “reduced the maximum number of “road crew” personnel (engineers, mechanics, crew/car chief, spotters) from 12 to 10 during race weekends. Additionally, the new rules will limit the amount of “organizational staff” for each organization to three. ”  This is to account for the wear on the car, the build of the car, and the coordination needed to drive in and out of the track.</p>
