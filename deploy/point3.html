                <p>Imagine the physical and mental challenges of this scenario: you are a NASCAR driver traveling at more than 175 mph, just inches away from other drivers also piloting their 3,400-lb machines.  The sun is shining in your eyes, your car isn’t handling well and it’s 90 degrees and humid. And as you head into a turn with sharp banking three seconds, the high G-forces put added pressure on your body.</p>

                <p>I’ve really been having fun trying to build some power, so I’ve been doing everything—explosive movements, a lot of jump squats, jump lunges, box jumps, explosive pushup drills, and things like that. I spent a lot of time on the bicycle and that’s been great. I’ve also worked really closely with a good friend of mine, Rob Hullett. Rob runs an MMA gym, and that training has really helped me, and I combine that with weights a couple of times a week.</p>

                <p>Taking a turn at Bristol (Motor Speedway) at 110 mph creates about 3.3G of lateral force on the driver. That’s comparable to the force astronauts felt on the Space Shuttle as it took off. Of course, the astronauts felt it for a minute. NASCAR drivers feel that force nine seconds out of every 15 for 500 laps (266.5 miles).</p><br>

                <h3>WHAT ARE THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS OF THE COCKPIT?</h3>
                <p>The temperatures in the driver's cockpit of a NASCAR race car can reach around 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Combine this temperature with a 500-lap race at 200 mph along with lack of air flow and you will see that NASCAR driver physical conditioning to build in endurance is critical.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Oxygen is a problem too. Since the cars are very aerodynamic so as to increase speed, the air is guided around the car but does not reach the inside. The driver's cockpit is not pressurized like an aircraft. So, the driver has to be able to process what oxygen he gets very efficiently. Therefore, NASCAR driver physical conditioning will include aerobic exercises so as to optimize the processing of oxygen by the body.</p>

                <p>The forces on the body are the same, however NASCAR drivers experience this four times every lap, for 500 consecutive laps.  Along with the lack of oxygen and it can get very extreme!</p>
